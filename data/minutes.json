	Notes: "Character-sets\\nThe CHARACTER SET clause specifies the character set in which the results are to be written. Without the clause, no conversion takes place (the binary character set). In this case, if there are multiple character sets, the output will contain these too, and may not easily be able to be reloaded.\\n\\nIn cases where you have two servers using different character-sets, using SELECT INTO OUTFILE to transfer data from one to the other can have unexpected results. To ensure that MariaDB correctly interprets the escape sequences, use the CHARACTER SET clause on both the SELECT INTO OUTFILE statement and the subsequent LOAD DATA INFILE statement.\\n\\n\",
