    heading: in a crowded world, kids need goals and paths
    text: >-
      A child’s reach must exceed its grasp, or what’s a heaven for? Sport gives
      kids the chance to have fun, experience aspiration, as well as to learn
      social, motor, and intellectual skills that will provide benefits all
      through their lives. Enabling the delivering on these potentials is
      typically the job of sports organizations working at local, regional,
      national and global levels. Managing such organizations, creating,
      measuring and fine tuning frameworks and policies effectively over time,
      presents its own sets of unique challenges - and opportunities.

      Every game happens by way of negotiation. Do you want to play? What rules?
      …and so on. As events involve more people from more places, require more
      resources, and translate to bigger “stakes” for participants, the
      discipline of delivery becomes more important - as typically does the
      potential audience for the event. The largest media events in the world
      are all sports events. Sports offers unique sets of channels into peoples’
      lives. Understanding and having experience in the management and delivery
      of sports at the highest levels informs and enriches the ability to help
      sports stay in touch with the times, grow and gain more relevance while
      extending global reach..

    heading: Sponsorship Enables Exceptional Outcomes
    text: >-
      The fundamental metric of Sponsorship is Fulfillment: did the Sponsorship
      deliver what was promised in the manner in which was promised as measured 
      by some kind of objective third party criteria. All successful
      sponsorships are founded on this principle. However the truly successful
      ones go well  beyond that. They are marriages in heaven that completely
      align for sport and sponsor at the brand level, and provide the capacity
      to build bridges far beyond what conventional marketing can accomplish.
      Aligning sport  success with sponsor brand success can make the impossible
      possible.
