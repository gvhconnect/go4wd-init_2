    heading: in a crowded world, kids need goals and paths more than ever
    text: >-
      Sport gives kids the chance to have fun, experience aspiration, as well as
      to learn social, motor, and intellectual skills that will provide benefits
      all through their lives. Enabling the delivering on these potentials is
      typically the job of sports organizations working at local, regional,
      national and global levels. Managing such organizations, creating,
      measuring and fine tuning frameworks and policies effectively over time,
      presents its own sets of unique challenges - and opportunities.

    heading: Sports' Impacts flow from Discipline on and off the pitch
    text: >-
      Every game happens by way of negotiation. Do you want to play? …what
      rules? …and so on. As events involve more people from more places, they
      require more resources that translate to bigger “stakes”.  Delivery
      becomes paramount - for the event and audiences. The largest global media
      events are sports events. Sports offers unique sets of pathways into
      peoples’ lives. Managing this process effectively defines the relevance of
      sports,  how they can grow and gain more relevance while extending global
      reach and impact..

    heading: Sponsorship Enables Exceptional Outcomes
    text: >-
      The fundamental metric of Sponsorship is Fulfillment: did the Sponsorship
      deliver what was promised in the manner in which was promised as measured 
      by some kind of objective third party criteria. All successful
      sponsorships are founded on this principle. However the truly successful
      ones go well  beyond that. They are marriages in heaven that completely
      align for sport and sponsor at the brand level, and provide the capacity
      to build bridges far beyond what conventional marketing can accomplish.
      Aligning sport  success with sponsor brand success can make the impossible
      possible.
