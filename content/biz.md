    heading: Smart Scaling in Business Has to be Built into Process
    text: >-
      Operations, Marketing and Development are all core aspects of business. 
      They must mesh, enable and drive business growth along with improvements
      in productivity and profitability.   Significant advances in business
      always have to do with the application of technology to scale productivity
      typically reducing time to market and significantly increasing margins.  
      Business success lies in enabling this evolution as a matter of process,
      while creating sustainable differentiation that will drive performance,
      growth and long term competitive advantage.

          Productivity gains can be had by moving hard to digital norms.  This
          is often low hanging fruit.

        text: >-
          New technologies change the cost base for customer relationships.
          Apple tripled its value by adding value in how content is being
          delivered, levering the phoneâ€™s value.

        text: >-
          With the Cloud  and the affordable, relatively low risk access to AI
          it makes available, the opportunity for ground breaking business
          innovation has never been greater.
