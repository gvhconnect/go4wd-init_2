      16,500 transistors took the first men to the moon. Each of the estimated
      100 million  iPhone 13s in circulation carries an A15 chip that has over
      15 billion on board each phone. The past 50 years have seen the world of
      data  become part of the fabric of  day to day living - though, curiously,
      we still live in  a very “flat” data world.  All that is now changing

      tools that will revolutionize the face of business…  …and within 10 years,
      not 50!
